  summary: "<p>The city of Townsville may be a beautiful, bustling metropolis, but don't be fooled! There's evil afoot! And only three things can keep the bad guys at bay: Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup, three super-powered little girls, known to their fans (and villains everywhere) as <b>The Powerpuff Girls</b>. Juggling school, bedtimes, and beating up giant monsters may be daunting, but together the Powerpuff Girls are up to the task. Battling a who's who of evil, they show what it really means to \"fight like a girl.\"</p>",
